# Quizaroth


Hello everyone and welcome to Quizaroth - a quiz game based on the Warcraft universe by Blizzard Entertainment.

This is the leaderboard microservice part of the back-end project:

1. To access the main back-end project    -> https://github.com/coldrefreader/Quizaroth
2. To access the front-end server and UI  -> https://github.com/coldrefreader/Front-end

The primary role of this microservice is to upload new information to the leaderboard database every time a game session concludes successfully. The information is refreshed daily at midnight or at every startup.
